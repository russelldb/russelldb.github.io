# Mafterning! The Only Greeting Remote Workers Need

Work remotely, sometimes? Or in an org with multiple global locations? How often have you heard:

"Good Morning, Good Afternoon, or Good Evening!" ?

More than once?

I've worked remote since 2011, mainly with US based companies. When I worked at Basho, one my colleagues (shame on me, I can't recall who!)
coined the portmanteau compressed neologism "Mafterning!" simply: Good **M**orning **after**noon eve**ning**.

I invite you to make use of this greeting to simplify communication across timezones.

Surprisingly, a Google search reveals no results for ‘Mafterning’—until now!
